A comprehensive tool for analyzing and verifying DWARF debug line table information in compiled binaries. This project helps developers identify and diagnose issues with debug information mapping between source code and compiled binaries.

## Features

- **DWARF Line Table Parsing**: Extract and analyze debug line information from compiled binaries
- **Dynamic Verification**: Use LLDB to verify that line numbers map correctly during execution
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with statistics and recommendations
- **Source Code Integration**: Write verification reports directly as comments in source files
- **Modular Architecture**: Use components separately or together for custom workflows
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple files in automated workflows
- **LLVM Version Tracking**: Reports include LLVM version information for reproducibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- LLVM toolchain (including `llvm-dwarfdump` and `lldb`)
- C/C++ binaries compiled with debug information (`-g` flag)

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edumoot/toolchains/src/lines.git
cd lines
```

2. Ensure LLVM tools are installed:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install llvm lldb

# macOS with Homebrew
brew install llvm

# Verify installation
llvm-config --version
lldb --version
```

### Basic Usage

Analyze a simple C program:

```bash
# Compile your program with debug info and an optimization level
clang -g -O3 example.c -o example

# Run the analyzer
python line_analyzer.py example.c example
```

## Understanding the Output
The analyzer provides clear distinction between:

**Lines found in line table**: All line numbers that have debug information
**Verified line numbers**: Lines that were successfully hit during execution

Example output:

```c
/*
*  ==================================================
*  ANALYSIS SUMMARY
*  ==================================================
*  LLVM version: 17.0.6
*  Binary: example
*  Source: example.c
*  Total lines in debug info: 42
*  Total lines tested: 42
*  Successfully verified: 38
*  Success rate: 90.5%
*
*  Lines found in debug info: [10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50, 52, 55, ...]
*
*  Verified line numbers: [10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, ...]

    python line_analyzer.py "$src" "build/$(basename $binary)"
done
```

## Architecture

The project follows a modular, object-oriented design:

```
line-table-analyzer/
├── models.py              # Core data structures and types
├── line_verifier.py       # DWARF parsing and LLDB verification
├── report_generator.py    # Report generation and formatting
├── line_table_analyzer.py # Main orchestrator and CLI
└── example_usage.py       # Usage examples and patterns
```

### Key Components

1. **DwarfLineTableParser**: Parses DWARF debug information using `llvm-dwarfdump`
2. **LLDBLineVerifier**: Verifies line mappings by setting breakpoints and running the binary
3. **VerificationReportGenerator**: Creates structured reports from verification results
4. **SourceFileReportWriter**: Writes reports as comments in source files
5. **LineTableAnalyzer**: Orchestrates the complete analysis workflow

## Report Format

The analyzer generates comprehensive reports including:

- **Executive Summary**: Overview of verification results
- **Verified Line Numbers**: List of successfully verified lines
- **Detailed Results**: Line-by-line verification status
- **Analysis Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving debug information
- **LLVM Version**: Version information for reproducibility

### Example Report

 */
```

## Programmatic Usage

The analyzer can be used as a library in your own Python scripts:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from line_analyzer import LineTableAnalyzer

# Create analyzer
analyzer = LineTableAnalyzer(
    timeout_seconds=45,
    comment_style="block",
    include_metadata=True
)

# Run analysis
result = analyzer.analyze(
    source_file=Path("src/main.c"),
    binary_file=Path("build/main"),
    output_dir=Path("reports/")
)

# Access results
if result.success:
    print(f"Verified {result.verified_count} lines")
    print(f"Success rate: {result.report_data.success_rate:.1f}%")

    # Get verified line numbers directly
    verified_lines = result.verified_line_numbers
    print(f"Verified lines: {verified_lines}")
```

### Using Components Separately

```python
from line_verifier import DwarfLineTableParser, LLDBLineVerifier
from line_report_generator import VerificationReportGenerator

# Parse DWARF information
parser = DwarfLineTableParser(Path("binary"))
parser.parse()
line_numbers = parser.get_line_numbers("source.c")

# Verify specific lines
verifier = LLDBLineVerifier(timeout_seconds=30)
results = verifier.verify_lines(
    Path("source.c"),
    Path("binary"),
    line_numbers[:10]  # Verify first 10 lines only
)

# Check which lines were verified
verified = [line for line, evidence in results.items() 
           if evidence.result == VerificationResult.VERIFIED]
print(f"Verified lines: {verified}")

# Generate custom report
generator = VerificationReportGenerator()
report_data = generator.generate_report(
    results,
    binary_name="binary",
    llvm_version="17.0.6"
)
```

## Output Interpretation
### Line Number Categories
1. **Lines found in line table**: All line numbers that have DWARF debug information
- These are the lines the debugger knows about
- Extracted using `llvm-dwarfdump --debug-line`
2. **Verified line numbers**: Lines that were successfully hit during execution
- These lines had valid breakpoints set
- The program actually executed these lines
- Confirmed using LLDB
3. **Invalid breakpoints**: Lines where breakpoints couldn't be set
- Often due to optimization
- May indicate dead code elimination
4. **Not hit**: Lines with valid breakpoints that weren't executed
- May indicate unreachable code
- Could be error handling or conditional code
5. Errors: Lines where verification failed
- Could be due to line number mismatches
- May indicate debug info corruption

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add type hints to all function signatures
- Include docstrings for all classes and methods
- Write unit tests for new functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"LLDB Python interface not found"**
   - Ensure LLDB is installed and accessible in PATH
   - Try running `lldb -P` to verify Python support

2. **"No line numbers found in binary"**
   - Verify the binary was compiled with `-g` flag
   - Check that source paths match between compilation and analysis

3. **"Breakpoint creation failed"**
   - Line might be optimized out - try compiling with `-O0`
   - Ensure source file paths are correct

### Debug Tips

- Use `--verbose` flag for detailed output
- Check generated `.backup_*` files if source is modified incorrectly
- Examine JSON summary files for detailed verification data
